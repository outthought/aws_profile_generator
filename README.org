* Generate AWS Profile Config From Template
With multiple AWS accounts, [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html][configuring the AWS CLI]] can be repetitive. Use this terraform configuration to generate a config file with profiles from values.

** Instructions
Run terraform to generate a file named =config=.
Copy =config= into =~/.aws/=.

** Variables
The variable =accounts= is a map of =account_name= to =account_number=.

Example.
#+begin_example hcl
accounts = {
  projecta = "123456789012"
  projectb = "987654321002"
}
#+end_example

It is used to name each profile block with the =account_name=, and to interpolate the value of =role_arn=, (=account_number= along with =role_name=).
#+begin_example conf
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::${account_number}:role/${role_name}
#+end_example

See =config.tmpl=.

See =variables.tf=.
